## Update by Gabriel Staples on 20 Mar 2022: I'm going to make my own version of this, here: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/sublime_gcode. Look there for all future contributions of mine for this.


# G-code syntax highlighting for Sublime Text
Syntax Definition for Sublime Text that provides highlighting for G code (ISO 6983, DIN 66025, RS-274)

# Installation


## Package Control

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the console. Then:

Enter:
``` 
Package Control: Install Package
```

Then search for:
``` 
G code
```

Install the package, and enjoy! `G-code` is now available as one of the syntax highlighting options!


## Out of Maintenance 

<s>Hi, unfortunately I stopped maintaining this shortly after creating it. I use vim almost exclusively now, and lately there has not been much new g code to read.</s>
